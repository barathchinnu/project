        Stone is the longest-lasting building material. The most ancient buildings in the world are made of stone. We commonly use stone in walls and floorings, and the texture makes it versatile. Stone comes with smooth finish textures to rough ones and also comes in many different colors. Examples of stones used in construction are sandstone, granite, and marble. Ordinary stone is cheap, but the prices go up for unique finishes. For marble countertops, quality and color increase the production time and cost.
