        Wood is arguably the oldest construction material as it has been in use. It is naturally available and cost-efficient, strong and durable, and flexible in all senses. It can be bent, molded, or cured into desirable shapes. Other than its durability, wood is an environmentally sustainable material. We can use wood for commercial and residential buildings, and it works well with other materials. It functionally works well with steel, marble, and aluminum. Compared to other construction materials, wood is relatively light and easy to standardize in size. It has high tensile strength and is good in soundproofing and insulation.
