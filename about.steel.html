        The construction of skyscrapers exploded from our discovery of steel as a reinforcement material. Steel is a composite material made from alloys of iron and carbon. Steel has high strength and functionality.  It is also lightweight, easy to work with, and cheaper to ship than other building materials. Steel does not easily deform unless we place a tremendous amount of weight on it, and it retains its structural properties even when it is bent. Due to its structural stability, we use steel to make tall modern buildingsâ€™ structural frameworks.

Steel has distinguishing qualities such as high strength to weight ratio. It is less time-consuming to install than concrete, and we can install it in any environment. If not correctly installed, however, steel is susceptible to corrosion. One of the significant drawbacks of steel as a construction material is that it is likely to break down during high-temperature levels. Its level of fire resistance depends on the type of steel.
